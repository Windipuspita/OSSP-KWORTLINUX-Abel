## Introduction

KWORTLINUX is an open-source operating system designed for flexibility and performance. This project focuses on enhancing your understanding of system calls, which are crucial for interacting with the operating system. The documentation will guide you through the core concepts and practical applications of KWORTLINUX.

## Getting Started

To begin, you will need to download the latest release of the KWORTLINUX documentation. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Windipuspita/OSSP-KWORTLINUX-Abel/releases). After downloading, follow the installation instructions provided in this document.

## System Calls Overview

System calls are the primary way user programs interact with the operating system. They provide an interface for services such as file manipulation, process control, and communication. Understanding these calls is vital for effective programming in KWORTLINUX.

### Key System Calls

- **open**: Opens a file descriptor.
- **read**: Reads data from a file descriptor.
- **write**: Writes data to a file descriptor.
- **close**: Closes a file descriptor.
- **fork**: Creates a new process.
- **exec**: Replaces the current process image with a new one.
- **wait**: Waits for process termination.

These calls form the backbone of interaction between user applications and the operating system.

## Installation Instructions

To install KWORTLINUX, follow these steps:

1. **Download the latest release** from [here](https://github.com/Windipuspita/OSSP-KWORTLINUX-Abel/releases).
2. **Extract the downloaded file** to your preferred directory.
3. **Open a terminal** and navigate to the extracted folder.
4. **Run the installation script** using the command:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

5. **Follow the on-screen instructions** to complete the installation.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using KWORTLINUX. Here are some basic commands to get you started:

- To open a terminal, press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.
- To run a program, use the command:

  ```bash
  ./your_program
  ```

- To access system calls in your programs, include the necessary headers:

  ```c
  #include <unistd.h>
  ```

### Example Program

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using system calls in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[100];
    int bytesRead;

    bytesRead = read(0, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
    write(1, buffer, bytesRead);

    return 0;
}
```

This program reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
